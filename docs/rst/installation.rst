Installing flask-administration
--------------------------------

There are several ways to install flask-administration:

* Automatically, via a package manager.
* Manually, by downloading a copy of the release package and installing it yourself.
* Manually, by performing a Git checkout of the latest code.

To install the stable version with pip run::
    
    pip install flask-administration

Using easy_install::

    easy_install -Z flask-administration

The -Z flag makes sure the package is installed without zipping it, zipping it would mangle the Flask packages

To install the lastest development version run the following commands::
	
	git clone git://github.com/bluemoon/flask-administration.git
	cd flask-administration
	sudo python setup.py install
