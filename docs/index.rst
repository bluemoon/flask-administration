Welcome to Flask-Administration's documentation!
================================================

Project Goal
-------------

The idea behind the project is to build a dashboard for adminstration in a way that it's both useful for business and its
useful for small companies, It's not meant to be a do everything dashboard right now. It's currently in an unusable state
but I hope some of the main functionality comes around soon.
